# BeweryDB
This was my first time working with an API in combination with React.
It took some effort, so I learned a lot during this assessment. I thought it was a very nice assignment to make.
Initially I started with two components where the data was collected and processed immediately.
Later I put the retrieval of the data in a separate component and then processed it in another component. This makes the code a lot easier to read.

I think it was even possible to merge the two components that now retrieve the data into one and make it into one function. Unfortunately I did not succeed because of a lack of time and knowledge.

The library I used is react-scroll. This library makes it easy to scroll from one to the component.


How to run this project:
Download or clone this repository.

Open the folder in your code editor and open the terminal

Navigate to the brewery-app

Then type: npm i -S react

When this is done type: npm start

The app will now open in the browser

To view the app properly you need a google extension.
I think it has to do with the API.
The extension you have to set is Moesif Orign & CORS Changer. Turn on the extension after installation.
