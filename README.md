This was my first time working with an API in combination with React.
It took some effort, so I learned a lot during this assessment. I thought it was a very nice assignment to make.
Initially I started with two components where the data was collected and processed immediately.
Later I put the retrieval of the data in a separate component and then processed it in another component. This makes the code a lot easier to read.

I think it was even possible to merge the two components that now retrieve the data into one and make it into one function. Unfortunately I did not succeed because of a lack of time and knowledge.

The library I used is react-scroll. This library makes it easy to scroll from one to the component.
